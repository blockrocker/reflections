How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 allowed a quick scan of a few lines versus the entire file...it showed me the places only where changes occurred

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   i would be more confident in my ability to try new things even after the code initially worked

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: makes it easier to understand what each change is about bc of comments
    Cons: programmer has to stay vigilant in when to commit without over committing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because Git wants to allow programmers to quickly find changes or errors relating to new code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows me when all of my commits were recorded along with a comment from me on what change was made

    git diff will enable me to quickly see where thoe precise changes were made to individual versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I now have the ability to track down and pinpoint exactly when a problem first began

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
